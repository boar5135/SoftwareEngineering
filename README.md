<h1>Software Engineering & CSC 160</h1>
<h3>An Overview of Mayuko's Video & the Syllabus</h3>
<p>In the video, Mayuko notes the expectations surrounding software engineering versus the reality of the job. She notes everything from the importance of soft skills to the fact that people can be themselves as a sofware engineer. Furthermore, she shares that the learning process for a software engineer does not end upon graduation and the process of learning it is lifelong. Similarly, the syllabus for CSC 160 highlights the importance of group work and the need for peers to provide feedback to one another. This and many of the points made in Mayuko's video are found in the syllabus for CSC 160 and are highlighted in the table below next to some points to consider adding to the syllabus.</p>

    <td>Both the video and syllabus emphasize the importance of collaboration. Mayuko discusses the work that she does in teams with her colleagues. Similarly, the syllabus incorporates collaboration with the peer work that is part of the course.</td>
<td>Unlike the video, the syllabus does not directly mention the importance of empathy and putting oneself in another's shoes to predict how they will react to a particular design or material.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
<td>Both Mayuko and the syllabus draw attention to the importance of providing feedback to others. As part of the CSC 160 course, students will be required to assess another's work, and this is similar to Mayuko's work environment where her and her colleagues provide feedback to each other to create the best products possible.</td>
    <td>While the video highlights the importance of soft skills and the need to be able to communicate, this is not stressed nearly as much in the syllabus.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Both the video and the syllabus emphasize the importance of appearance and that it is crucial that the product be visually appealing and desirable to the consumer.</td>
    <td>Unlike the video, the syllabus does not remind students that learning how to design websites and code does not end when the class does.</td>
